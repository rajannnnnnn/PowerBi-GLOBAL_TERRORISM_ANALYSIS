This project aims to deliver a insightful reports from the records of Terrorisms took place all over the world from 1970 to 2017, with 3 sections on it.

STEP-by-STEP progress of the project:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1)  [Data souring] - Microsoft Excel
      Looking over the data and understanding it.
      Dataset overview:
      - 113 features
      - 181,629 records
      |
      |
(2)  [Data Cleaning] - Microsoft Excel
      Dealing the inconsistency ex. missing values and outliers.
      |
      |
(3)  [Data Transformation] - Microsoft Excel, Power Query Editor
      Necessary transformations that optimizes further interpretations.
      |
      |
(4)  [Data Modelling] - Power Bi Desktop
      Creating relationships between Queries are crucial for DAX and reports.
      - It was 21 Queries finally after all transformations.
      |
      |
(5)  [Data Analysis Expression] - Power Bi Desktop
      Measure and Calculated Columns that help enhancing the visual reports.
      |
      |
(6)  [Report Making] - Power Bi Desktop
      Outcomes (as visual reports):

(7)  [Writing Documentation] - README.md
      While not the part of project, but it is necessary after the project.

By this project, I gained supreme knowledge on how to deal a complex data and driving it to visuals. In every aspects of this journey, I met something new and unknown. Sometimes, I had to start everything from the beginning.

I learned 
- to make bridge columns which improves efficiency in storage,
- to combine same set information which is found in different columns by pivoting methods, (ex. a terrorism can fall under more than 1 category)
- admire the supremacy of Map visualization
